            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>The Bonny Method:
</strong></p><p>Helen Lindquist was a Music Therapist who developed the approach of using imagery with music. Mental imagery is used to aid phycological and physiological issues in patients. The patient is asked to focus on image, which then leads to a starting point to think and talk about problems. Bonny then added music which helped heal and find solutions with increased awareness. In this way, music is considered as a co-therapist and is a significant role in the treatment of music therapy. 
</p><p><strong>Dalcroze Eurhythmics:
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Dalcroze Eurhythmics which is also known as the Dalcroze method. This method is used to teach music to students, this can be a form of music therapy. This method was developed by Emile jaques-dalcroze. The method is used by a student focusing on rhythm, structure and movement expression. This will improve the physical awareness, which helps patients with motor difficulties hugely. 
</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Kodaly:
</strong></p><p>Zoltán Kodály is considered to be the inspiration for development of the philosophy of music therapy. The method uses the base of rhythm, notation, sequence and movement to help aid the healing and learning of a patient. This practice improves the intonation, rhythm and music literacy, has positive impact of perceptual function, motor skills and learning performance in a therapeutic setting. 
</p><p><strong>Neurologic music therapy (NMT):
</strong></p><p>This practice is based on neuroscience, specifically perception and production of music and function of brain and behaviours. Specialists claim that when this method is used the brain changes and develops as direct consequence of engaging with music. This is beneficial as it could train motor responses like tapping a foot to music etc.  
</p><p><strong>Nordoff-Robbins:
</strong></p><p>Paul Nordoff and Clive Robbins, investigated the treatment music therapy in disabled children. They held projects with children affected by autism, mental disorders an emotional disturbances, developmental delays and other learning difficulties. The core aspect of the Nordoff-Robbins method assumes that everyone can find meaning and benefit from music with the help of a therapist. This technique can accommodate many patients with the experience and ability levels.  
</p><p><strong>Orff-Schulwerk:
</strong></p><p>This practice was made by Gertrude Orff. Her technique helped with developmental delays and disabilities. Orff deveoped this because she believed that medicine alone was not sufficient. She emphasised the treatment in education (“schulwerk” translates from German to “schoolwork”) and uses music to improve the learning ability of children. It also improves the interaction between patient and other people.

Also listening to sad music can also bring a negative feeling of grief. However, most experiances were positive. the results of the test helped pinpoint ways people regulate mood and how music therapy and rehab tap into the processof comfort and relief and enjoyment. The study helped find reasons why people avoid and want to listen to sad music. An earlier study found that people prefer sad music when they are sad or are having deep loss, for example, an end of realationship. Sad music provides the substitute for a lost realationshio, like an empathitic friend. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br><strong>UPBEAT MUIC BRINGS JOY:</strong></p><p>The Journal of Positive Phycology Study in 2013, resulted that when people listen to happy music their mood and happiness boosted in just 2 weeks. When &nbsp;participants tried to improve it only succeeded when thy listened to upbeat music of 'Copland' as oppsed music of 'Stravinsky' which are usually sadder. A happier mood is linked to a better physical health, higher income and greater relationship satisfaction.</p><p></p>

</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: normal;">A study in 2015, resulted that before, during and after ecperianced less anxiety and pian in surgery compared to people who didn't listen to music. Music therpay helps manage stress, enhances memory and alleviates pain. People who listened to music didn't need as much medication after surgery. Resear hes looked at 73 different trials that involved more than 7,000 patients.

</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: normal;">Music can play a powerful role. A recent study by the World journal of psychiatry found that music therapy was an effective treatment for mood disorders related to neurological conditions. e.g. Parkinson's disease, dementia, stroke and multiple sclerosis. 25 trials, resulted that music is a reasonable therapy to help reduce depression, anxiety, mood, self-esteem and quality of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: normal;"><br></span><strong>Music Therapy Positives: </strong></p><p><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: normal;">Music Therapy has no negative side effects which means it's a low- risk treatment. Barry Goldstein, a recording artist who studied, vibrational effects of music, had said that music can enhance brain functions, evoke emotion, help regain memories, simulate new neural connection and active attention. Also music is non-invasive, cheap and safe.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
